My focus these days is building websites for medium and large business. Today when small businesses come to me for help, I just show them how easy and cheap it is for them to create their own site themselves. </p>
            
            <p>In this short article I am going to do exactly the same. I will provide you with all the information and guidance you need to get your site up and running in no time – and with very low costs. See the video tutorial, read the article and I’m sure you will be able to create your own stunning website in no time. </p>

                   Hey, I'm Steven Woods. I grew up in London - England but moved across the Atlantic 5 years ago.  I started with website development when I was in high school and the first website I did was for my father's real estate business and slowly started building websites for small, medium and large businesses. My main  focus this days is building sites for large businesses only, and acting as a consultant for people looking to build their own website by themselves. Over the course of my building and consulting, I have experienced many different types of web building software so am excellently placed to pass on my knowledge and help my friends and family to build easy, professional and affordable websites.
